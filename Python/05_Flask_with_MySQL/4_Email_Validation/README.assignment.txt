Assignment: Email Validation with DB

Create an application that asks a user to enter an email address and validates whether that email exists within the database.

index.html (see: README.assignment.wireframe1.png)

Errors (see: README.assignment.wireframe2.png)
- If the email address is not valid, have a notification "Email is not valid!" to display on the homepage.

success.html (see: README.assignment.wireframe3.png)
- Once a valid email address is entered:
  - Save to the database the email address the user entered
  - On the success page, display all the email addresses entered
    along with the date and the time (e.g. June 24th, 2013, 6:00 PM)
    when the email addresses were entered

Bonus
Add a delete button onto your success page that allows the user to delete entries from the database.
With the bonus feature added, your app should look a little different than above!
