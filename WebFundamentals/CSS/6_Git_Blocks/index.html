          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series
            of snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each
            snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a
            full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and
            come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments
            into your app.</p>
          <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
          <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
            It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using
            those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

              <h2>Git init</h2>
              <p>Git init is the act of registering this current code base.</p>
            </div
            ><div id="git_add" class="text_box">
              <h2>Git add</h2>
              <p>Git add is how we stage the integration of our current code base into our current list of snapshots.</p>

            ><div id="git_status" class="text_box">
              <h2>Git status</h2>

              <h2>Git commit</h2>
              <p>Git commit; finally we can commit those changes we added to our
                last snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever
                new changes were made.</p>
            </div
            ><div id="git_remote_add" class="text_box">
              <h2>Git remote add</h2>
              <p>Git remote add is used to set up a online repository where we
                can place all of our current code. This is where the outside
                world can see our code base.</p>

          ><div id="git_push" class="text_box">
            <h2>Git push</h2>
            <p>Git push is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to
              store all of our repositories. Other developers might look at our
              existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our
              code and add new features or even update our code base with features
              they wanted to add.</p>
