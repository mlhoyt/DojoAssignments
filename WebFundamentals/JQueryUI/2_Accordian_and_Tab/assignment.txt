Assignment: Accordion and Tab

Build a simple page using both an accordion and a tab widget. Get comfortable
with inserting markup correctly into jQueryUI elements. Pay attention to how
jQueryUI examples utilize the class and id attributes.

Once you have built your page, find a new jQueryUI element and add it to your page.

Don't spend more than 3 hours trying to get this to work.
