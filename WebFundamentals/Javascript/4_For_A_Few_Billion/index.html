      // There is an old tale about a king who offered a servant $10,000 as a reward.
      // The servant instead asked that for 30 days he be given an amount that would double,
      // starting with a penny.
      //   - 1 penny for the first day
      //   - 2 for the second
      //   - 4 for the third
      //   - then 8, 16, 32 pennies, and so on
      //
      // Use for loops to answer the following:
      //
      // How much was the reward after 30 days?
      // remember, a penny isn't 1, but 0.01
      //
      // Bonus (Only If You Have Time):
      //
      // How many days would it take the servant to make $10,000?
      // How about 1 billion?
      // In JavaScript, there is a value Infinity, how many days until the servant has infinite money?
