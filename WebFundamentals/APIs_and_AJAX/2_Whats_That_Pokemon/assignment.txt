Assignment: What's that Pokemon? Build Your Own Pokedex

    +-----------------------------+-------------------------+
    | <Pokemon_Character_Images>  | <Selected_Pokemon_Info> |
    | ...                         | ...                     |

When an image is clicked, we get its info in the sidebar.

How do you know which Pokemon was clicked? Maybe we can give each Pokemon
a unique id that corresponds with their number in the URL?

    <img id="2" src="http://pokeapi.co/media/img/2.png">

By adding an {id} to the end of this URL:

    http://pokeapi.co/api/v1/pokemon/{id}/

And making the AJAX request with that URL, we retrieve all the
character info.

Selected Pokemon Info contains:

    <Name>

    <Image>

    Types
      * <type>
      ...

    Height

    <height>

    Weight

    <weight>
