Assignment: Your Very Own Weather Forecast App!

Let's build a weather forecast application where we can input any city and find
out the temperature in Fahrenheit. Thankfully there is an API or a set of URLs
out there that will tell us the temperature of any city! We will be using the
Open Weather API. Open Weather API gives us a set of very useful URLs that are
fun to use. For example, navigate to the link:

    http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&&appid={API_ID}

and you will find JSON data about London, UK. In fact, even if you try to navigate to:

    http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=California,us%appid={API_ID}

the API will find you the same JSON data. This means that we have to validate
different users' responses less on our application. Thanks, Open Weather API!

We are going to have a form that our user can enter a city in a form and have
the city's temperature displayed on the screen. We will be listening for a form
to be submitted so that we can gather what the user has filled out and add it
to our URL http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=. For example, if
the user has typed in 'Los Angeles', we would add this input to the API URL
so that the URL ends up being:

    http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Los Angeles&&appid={API_ID}

We can listen to a form being submitted with jQuery's submit() function. However,
the submit() function automatically reloads the page so we are going to be returning
false. Now that we know how to do AJAX we don't want our page to reload: we want the
data to come to us and then we can dynamically update the parts that need to be
updated in our current page. This should be a good starting point for setting up your
jQuery to build this application.

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('form').submit(function() {
        // your code here (build up your url)
        $.get(url, function(res) {
            // your code here
        }, 'json');
        // don't forget to return false so the page doesn't refresh
        return false;
    });
});
