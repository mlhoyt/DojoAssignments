Contact Card

You are going to design a contact card page. The user should be able to input
contacts to the page. Using the techniques demonstrated in the videos, you must
use jQuery to append new data to the page and make the content interactive.
Remember, the content you are making is dynamic, so be sure to attach your
handlers appropriately.

NOTE: we recommend using $(document).on("click", ".btn") for this assignment as opposed to $(".btn").click()

Note: Upload your work in GitHub and allow your collaborators to add/suggest new
features for your work.

GitHub is a social network hub for programmers. You can look at what other
programmers are working on, check their code and make suggestions or changes.
You may share projects you are working on and collaborate with other programmers
for updates or additional features. Upload your work for this exercise on GitHub
and ask some of your cohort mates or other programmers to peruse your code and
suggest changes/updates. Do the same thing for your cohort mates' work.
